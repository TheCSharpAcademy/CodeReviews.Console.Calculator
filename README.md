# Calculator
The second project from [thecsharpacademy.com](https://thecsharpacademy.com) build a very simple Calculator app. 
Following Microsoft's [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-create-first-app/)
with additional challenges.
### Introduction
For your second project, you'll build a Console Calculator App with the help of Microsoft’s Documentation. 
This project shouldn't be more difficult than the first, but you'll learn important skills such as 
having multiple projects in a solution, writing to files, and debugging. 
It will also serve as practice in a very important skill: following written documentation. 
This is something you’ll be doing on a regular basis as a professional developer, 
so it’s essential that you’re comfortable applying text-based instructions when developing software.

### Challenges
- [x] Create a functionality that will count the amount of times the calculator was used.
- [x] Store a list with the latest calculations. And give the users the ability to delete that list.
- [x] Allow the users to use the results in the list above to perform new calculations.
- [x] Add extra calculations: Square Root, Taking the Power, 10x, Trigonometry functions.
