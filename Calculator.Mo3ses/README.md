# The C# Academy - Calculator 

## Introduction
For your second project you'll build a Console Calculator App with the help of Microsoft’s Documentation. If this is your first time building a project on your own, I suggest you first watch this series from our C# Foundation area, where we walk you through how to create a console app from scratch, while explaining important concepts in C#. If you have already watched it, or created applications before, this will be a breeze. But it’s still helpful to reinforce your knowledge.

It will also serve as practice in a very important skill: following written documentation. This is something you’ll be doing on a regular basis as a professional developer, so it’s essential that you’re comfortable applying text-based instructions when developing software.
